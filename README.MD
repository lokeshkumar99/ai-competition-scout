# AI Competition Scout

This project is a Python-based web scraper that monitors competitor websites for new feature releases, uses the Gemini API for summarization, and displays the results via a Flask API and a simple web UI.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file and add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_CONNECTION_URI`.
